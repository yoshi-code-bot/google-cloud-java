/**
 * A client to Vision AI API
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= HealthCheckServiceClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: HealthCheckService provides an interface for Vertex AI Vision Cluster
 * Health Check.
 *
 * <p>Sample for HealthCheckServiceClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (HealthCheckServiceClient healthCheckServiceClient = HealthCheckServiceClient.create()) {
 *   HealthCheckRequest request =
 *       HealthCheckRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setCluster(ClusterName.of("[PROJECT]", "[LOCATION]", "[CLUSTER]").toString())
 *           .build();
 *   HealthCheckResponse response = healthCheckServiceClient.healthCheck(request);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>======================= LiveVideoAnalyticsClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Service describing handlers for resources. The service enables clients to
 * run Live Video Analytics (LVA) on the streaming inputs.
 *

 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (LiveVideoAnalyticsClient liveVideoAnalyticsClient = LiveVideoAnalyticsClient.create()) {
 *   LocationName parent = LocationName.of("[PROJECT]", "[LOCATION]");
 *   List<OperatorQuery> queries = new ArrayList<>();
 *   ResolveOperatorInfoResponse response =
 *       liveVideoAnalyticsClient.resolveOperatorInfo(parent, queries);
 * }
 * }</pre>
