 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (KeyDashboardServiceClient keyDashboardServiceClient = KeyDashboardServiceClient.create()) {
 *   ProjectName parent = ProjectName.of("[PROJECT]");
