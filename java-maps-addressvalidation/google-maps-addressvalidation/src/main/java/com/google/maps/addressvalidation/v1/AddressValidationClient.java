// AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION AND CLASS.
/**
 * Service Description: The service for validating addresses.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (AddressValidationClient addressValidationClient = AddressValidationClient.create()) {
 *   ValidateAddressRequest request =
 *       ValidateAddressRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setAddress(PostalAddress.newBuilder().build())
 *           .setPreviousResponseId("previousResponseId468754323")
 *           .setEnableUspsCass(true)
 *           .build();
 *   ValidateAddressResponse response = addressValidationClient.validateAddress(request);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the AddressValidationClient object to clean up resources
 * such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls
 * close().
 *
 * <table>
 *    <caption>Methods</caption>
 *    <tr>
 *      <th>Method</th>
 *      <th>Description</th>
 *      <th>Method Variants</th>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *      <td><p> ValidateAddress</td>
 *      <td><p> Validates an address.</td>
 *      <td>

 *      <td><p> Feedback about the outcome of the sequence of validation attempts. This should be the last call made after a sequence of validation calls for the same address, and should be called once the transaction is concluded. This should only be sent once for the sequence of `ValidateAddress` requests needed to validate an address fully.</td>
 *      <td>
 *      <p>Request object method variants only take one parameter, a request object, which must be constructed before the call.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *           <li><p> provideValidationFeedback(ProvideValidationFeedbackRequest request)
 *      </ul>
 *      <p>Callable method variants take no parameters and return an immutable API callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.</p>
 *      <ul>

 *      </ul>
 *       </td>
 *    </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of AddressValidationSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * AddressValidationSettings addressValidationSettings =
 *     AddressValidationSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * AddressValidationClient addressValidationClient =
 *     AddressValidationClient.create(addressValidationSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * AddressValidationSettings addressValidationSettings =
 *     AddressValidationSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * AddressValidationClient addressValidationClient =
 *     AddressValidationClient.create(addressValidationSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To use REST (HTTP1.1/JSON) transport (instead of gRPC) for sending and receiving requests over
 * the wire:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * AddressValidationSettings addressValidationSettings =
 *     AddressValidationSettings.newHttpJsonBuilder().build();
 * AddressValidationClient addressValidationClient =
 *     AddressValidationClient.create(addressValidationSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
