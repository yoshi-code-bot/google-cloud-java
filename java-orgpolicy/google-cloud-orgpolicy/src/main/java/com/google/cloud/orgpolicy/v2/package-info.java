/**
 * A client to Organization Policy API
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= OrgPolicyClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: An interface for managing organization policies.
 *
 * <p>The Organization Policy Service provides a simple mechanism for organizations to restrict the
 * allowed configurations across their entire resource hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>You can use a policy to configure restrictions on resources. For example, you can enforce a
 * policy that restricts which Google Cloud APIs can be activated in a certain part of your resource
 * hierarchy, or prevents serial port access to VM instances in a particular folder.
 *
 * <p>Policies are inherited down through the resource hierarchy. A policy applied to a parent
 * resource automatically applies to all its child resources unless overridden with a policy lower
 * in the hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>A constraint defines an aspect of a resource's configuration that can be controlled by an
 * organization's policy administrator. Policies are a collection of constraints that defines their
 * allowable configuration on a particular resource and its child resources.
 *
 * <p>Sample for OrgPolicyClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (OrgPolicyClient orgPolicyClient = OrgPolicyClient.create()) {
 *   PolicyName name = PolicyName.ofProjectPolicyName("[PROJECT]", "[POLICY]");
 *   Policy response = orgPolicyClient.getPolicy(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
