# Troubleshooting

## Logging

Our libraries use the Java logging API via `java.util.logging` package.
Configuring logging level reveals various facts that help your troubleshooting,
including:

- The timing of underlying client-server communication
- Request and response message headers
- Verbose messages in underlying dependency libraries

While there are various ways to configure the logging,
to quickly enable verbose logging for the Google Cloud Java libraries, create
a file `logging.properties` with the following content:

```
# run java program pointing to this properties file with the java arg
#   -Djava.util.logging.config.file=path/to/logging.properties
handlers=java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format=%1$tF %1$tT,%1$tL %4$-8s %3$-50s - %5$s %6$s%n

# --- ConsoleHandler ---
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=ALL
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter
.level=INFO

# --- Specify logging level for certain packages ---
# com.google.api is for HTTP 1.1 layer
com.google.api.level=ALL
# io.grpc is for gRPC + Netty layer
io.grpc.level=FINE
# com.google.auth is for authentication
com.google.auth.level=FINE

# Example when we want to specify storge library's level. This works when
# the target Cloud library uses the logging API.
com.google.cloud.storage.level=INFO
```

and run your application with `-Djava.util.logging.config.file=path/to/logging.properties`
as the "VM argument" (not "Program argument").

If you use IntelliJ, you specify the VM argument in "Run/Debug Configuration":

![Screenshot of IntelliJ configuration](docs/logging_vm_options.png)

If the JVM of your program is running with the configuration correctly, you see
the FINE-level logging in your console. Example output:

```
2023-04-05 13:03:01,761 FINE     com.google.auth.oauth2.DefaultCredentialsProvider  - Attempting to load credentials from well known file: /usr/local/google/home/suztomo/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json
2023-04-05 13:03:01,847 FINE     io.grpc.ManagedChannelRegistry                     - Unable to find OkHttpChannelProvider
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: io.grpc.okhttp.OkHttpChannelProvider
	at java.base/jdk.internal.loader.BuiltinClassLoader.loadClass(BuiltinClassLoader.java:581)
	at java.base/jdk.internal.loader.ClassLoaders$AppClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoaders.java:178)
	at java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:522)
	at java.base/java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method)
	at java.base/java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:315)
...
```

Note that you may see many stacktraces printed there.
As long as it's "FINE" level, they are not errors.

This is just one way to configure logging level.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/logging/overview.html).

## ALPN is not configured properly

If you see exceptions related to `ALPN is not configured properly`, such as:

```
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: ALPN is not configured properly. See https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/SECURITY.md#troubleshooting for more information.
```

Please use the [compatibility checker](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/tree/master/google-cloud-util/google-cloud-compat-checker) to see if your environment is compatible with grpc-based clients. The incompatibility can mean that:
- You are not on a [supported platform](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/#supported-platforms).
- There are classpath conflicts with `netty`.
- Or, you are seeing any of the conflicts specified in [gRPC Troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/SECURITY.md#troubleshooting).

## ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchMethodError, NoClassDefFoundError

These errors are usually caused by having multiple versions or conflicting versions of the same dependency in the classpath.
Usually these dependency conflicts occur with `guava` or `protobuf-java`.

There may be multiple sources for classpath conflicts:
- Multiple versions of the same transitive dependency in the dependency tree
- Your runtime classpath has different versions of dependencies than what you specified in the build

For example, if you have a direct or a transitive dependency on Guava version 19.0, 
and `google-cloud-java` uses Guava version 30.0, 
then `google-cloud-java` could be using Guava methods that don't exist in Guava 19.0,
and cause `NoSuchMethodError`.

Similarily, if your classpath has an older version of `protobuf-java`, 
but `google-cloud-java` requires a newer version,
 then you might see `NoClassDefFoundError` that fails to initialize `google-cloud-java` classes. For example:

```
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class com.google.pubsub.v1.PubsubMessage$AttributesDefaultEntryHolder
```

### Validate the conflict

Check the dependency tree to see if you have multiple versions of the same dependencies:

```
$ mvn dependency:tree
```

Look for versions of potentially conflicting dependencies like `guava`, `protobuf-java`, etc.

If you experience the error only during runtime, then your runtime environment
might  be introducing conflicting JARs into your runtime classpath. A typical case
is that Hadoop, Spark, or other server software that your application runs on
has conflicting versions `netty`, `guava`, or `protobuf-java` JARs in the classpath.

### Detecting conflicts during build

To detect dependency linkage errors at compile time, add the 
[Linkage Checker Enforcer Rule](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-opensource-java/tree/master/enforcer-rules)
in your pom.xml:

```
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.0.0-M3</version>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
            <artifactId>linkage-checker-enforcer-rules</artifactId>
            <version>1.5.7</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>enforce-linkage-checker</id>
            <!-- Important! Should run after compile -->
            <phase>verify</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>enforce</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <rules>
                <LinkageCheckerRule
                    implementation="com.google.cloud.tools.dependencies.enforcer.LinkageCheckerRule"/>
              </rules>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
```

There is no way to detect runtime classpath conflicts though. You need to be fully
aware of which JARs/classes are included in the runtime classpath
as every server environment is different.

### Resolving the conflict

There are different strategies to resolve conflicts, but you must understand the root cause of the conflicts. For example:

- If you have control over the dependency tree, upgrade
  offending dependencies (for example, upgrading Guava version). This is the 
  least hackish approach, but it is a lot of work that can require multiple releases
   of multiple libraries to sync everything up. 
- If you can't modify and push new versions of your dependencies, import
  `com.google.cloud:libraries-bom:25.1.0` (or a more recent version) and use that to
  select consistent dependency versions. This is the easiest route. 
  For example, this is how you can depend on consistent versions of Guava and 
  `com.google.cloud:google-cloud-storage` without explicitly setting the version of either one:
  
```
  ...
  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>libraries-bom</artifactId>
        <version>25.1.0</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
       </dependency>
     </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>
  ...
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>google-cloud-storage</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
      <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ...
  </dependencies>
  ...
```

- The release note of the libraries-bom shows the compatible dependency libraries.
  For example, https://github.com/googleapis/java-cloud-bom/releases/tag/v26.31.0 shows
  
  > These client libraries are built with the following Java libraries:
  >
  > - Guava: 32.1.3-jre
  > - Protobuf Java: 3.25.2
  > - Google Auth Library: 1.22.0
  > - Google API Client: 2.2.0
  > - gRPC: 1.61.0
  > - GAX: 2.41.0
  > - Google Cloud Core: 2.31.0
  
  By examining the dependency graph of your project (`mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose`,
  `gradle dependencies`, or `sbt dependencyTree`), you may find some of the dependencies
  having unexpected versions. They might cause dependency conflicts.

- If changing dependency versions causes other failures, 
  consider [shading dependencies](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/)
  that conflict with Google Cloud Java libraries.

  For example, to shade `guava` and `protobuf-java`:

```
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
    <executions>
      <execution>
        <phase>package</phase>
        <goals>
          <goal>shade</goal>
        </goals>
        <configuration>
          <keepDependenciesWithProvidedScope>false</keepDependenciesWithProvidedScope>
          <relocations>
            <!-- move protobuf to a shaded package -->
            <relocation>
              <pattern>com.google.protobuf</pattern>
              <shadedPattern>myapp.shaded.com.google.protobuf</shadedPattern>
            </relocation>
            <!-- move Guava to a shaded package -->
            <relocation>
              <pattern>com.google.common</pattern>
              <shadedPattern>myapp.shaded.com.google.common</shadedPattern>
            </relocation>
          </relocations>
        </configuration>
      </execution>
    </executions>
  </plugin>
```
