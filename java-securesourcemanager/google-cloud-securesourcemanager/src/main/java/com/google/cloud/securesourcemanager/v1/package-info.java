/**
 * A client to Secure Source Manager API
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= SecureSourceManagerClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Secure Source Manager API
 *
 * <p>Access Secure Source Manager instances, resources, and repositories.
 *
 * <p>This API is split across two servers: the Control Plane and the Data Plane.
 *
 * <p>Data Plane endpoints are hosted directly by your Secure Source Manager instance, so you must
 * connect to your instance's API hostname to access them. The API hostname looks like the
 * following:
 *
 * <p>https://[instance-id]-[project-number]-api.[location].sourcemanager.dev
 *
 * <p>For example,
 *
 * <p>https://my-instance-702770452863-api.us-central1.sourcemanager.dev
 *
 * <p>Data Plane endpoints are denoted with &#42;&#42;Host: Data Plane&#42;&#42;.
 *
 * <p>All other endpoints are found in the normal Cloud API location, namely,
 * `securcesourcemanager.googleapis.com`.
 *
 * <p>Sample for SecureSourceManagerClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (SecureSourceManagerClient secureSourceManagerClient = SecureSourceManagerClient.create()) {
 *   InstanceName name = InstanceName.of("[PROJECT]", "[LOCATION]", "[INSTANCE]");
 *   Instance response = secureSourceManagerClient.getInstance(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
