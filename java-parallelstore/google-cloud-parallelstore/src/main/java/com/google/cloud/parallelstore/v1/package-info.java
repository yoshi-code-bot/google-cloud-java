/**
 * A client to Parallelstore API
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= ParallelstoreClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Service describing handlers for resources Configures and manages
 * parallelstore resources.
 *
 * <p>Parallelstore service.
 *
 * <p>The `parallelstore.googleapis.com` service implements the parallelstore API and defines the
 * following resource model for managing instances:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/&#42;`
 *   <li>Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/&#42;`
 *   <li>Each location has a collection of instances named `/instances/&#42;`.
 *   <li>Parallelstore instances are resources of the form:
 *       `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note that location_id must be a Google Cloud `zone`; for example:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>`projects/12345/locations/us-central1-c/instances/my-parallelstore-share`
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Sample for ParallelstoreClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (ParallelstoreClient parallelstoreClient = ParallelstoreClient.create()) {
 *   InstanceName name = InstanceName.of("[PROJECT]", "[LOCATION]", "[INSTANCE]");
 *   Instance response = parallelstoreClient.getInstance(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
